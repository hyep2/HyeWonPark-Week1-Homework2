    <h5>Welcome to my page! My name is Hye Won and I am an aspiring software engineer. Earlier in my career, I received my
    Bachelor of Science degree in Physiological Sciences at University of California, Los Angeles in the hopes of pursuing a
    medical profession. After many years of both clinical and research experiences, I have developed a multidimensional
    perspective of medicine and came to appreciate the compassion of many healthcare workers. After such a period of time,
    however, I arrived at a difficult decision to pursue a subject matter that I deemed more fitting of my personality and
    skillset. Ever since high school, and throughout my undergraduate life as well, I was particularly drawn to the subject
    of computer science. Math has always been a strong suit of mine, and even while working in my clinical settings in the
    past, I naturally gravitated towards more computational tasks. This resolve of mine gradually grew stronger as I matured
    in my professional life and ultimately made the leap of faith to enroll in UCI's FullStack Coding Bootcamp to
    legitimately pursue computer science as a career. 
    <br>
    <br>
    This portfolio is a reflection of the hard work and dedication I put
    into mastering this particular subject. Although the time may have been short, I regard my experience to have been a
    proper introduction to the world of tech. I am quick and eager to learn, and I believe that my compassionate and
    interpersonal skills from my past experiences can only make me a more resourceful and meticulous software engineer. </h5>
